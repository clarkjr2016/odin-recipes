    <p>Everything you need to know about how to make Air Fryer hamburgers that will stay juicy, with no extra fat, and absolutely delicious!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef (80/20 mix of lean beef to fat)</li>
            <li>¼ cup corn starch</li>
            <li>Buns</li>
    
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the hamburger mix. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef with the garlic, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Just fold in the other ingredients in the ground beef and make sure not to over mix the mixture. </li>
            <li>Using your hands, quickly shape the hamburger patties and place them on a tray. You want to make sure that the meat stays cold because if you overwork the meat then the temperature of your hands will warm the meat up and that can result in really dense hamburgers.</li>
            <li>To shape the burgers, it’s also a good idea to wet your hands a little as this will prevent the meat from sticking to your hands.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that the patties must be bigger than the bread buns, as they will shrink when you air fry them.</li>
            <li>Preheat your air fryer to 395°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Lightly spray the air fryer basket with non-stick spray, and place your hamburger patties in the basket and cook to your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>The best way to check for the doneness of the hamburger is by inserting a food thermometer in the center of the patty. </li>
        </ol>
