    <p>Healthy Baked Honey Garlic Soy Chicken Wings are Spicy, Sweet, Sticky, and worth every bite! They’re first oven-baked then coated in a honey garlic soy sauce that hits all the right flavor notes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds wings</li>
            <li>¼ cup corn starch</li>
            <li>1 tsp <strong>garlic powder</strong></li>
            <li>1 tsp <strong>paprika</strong></li>
            <li>Dash salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top of it.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken wings, corn starch, and spices. Transfer in a single layer onto the rack.</li>
            <li>Bake 50-60 minutes, flipping halfway through until the wings are golden and cooked through.</li>
            <li>While the wings are baking, heat a pan over medium-high heat. Add the butter and garlic and cook for 30 seconds or until garlic begins to brown. Stir in the remaining ingredients for the sauce and simmer for just a few seconds</li>
            <li>Remove wings from the oven and toss into the sauce until fully coated. Serve immediately.</li>
